* Which type of hosts to acquire more and where?
* The categorisation of customers based on their preferences.
* What are the neighbourhoods they need to target?
* What is the pricing ranges preferred by customers?
* The various kinds of properties that exist w.r.t. customer preferences.
* Adjustments in the existing properties to make it more customer-oriented.
* What are the most popular localities and properties in New York currently?

## End Objective  

* To understand key insights from Airbnb NYC dataset analysis 
* To understand the customer preferences and user experience trends 
* To influence strategies to revive the business once restrictions are removed.

## Visulization Tool 

Tableau has been used as the Data Visualization tool as it is a very powerful, secure and flexible end to end analytics platform where we can visualize our data quickly and easily by creating interactive dashboards and convey an overall story using storyboard. Tableau is been used predominantly in the industry for creating powerful visualizations.

We Conducted through Exploratory Analysis of the Airbnb dataset in Tableau. The CSV file when uploaded to Tableau contained 49k records approximately. 
The idea is to dive deep into Hosts and Host listings and slice and dice them by various dimensions like neighborhood, price ranges, accommodation types, availability and customer reviews.

Univariate and bi-variate analysis was performed on different columns in tableau such as on the basis of price, availibity_365,minimum_nights, room type etc.
